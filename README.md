# DSA Worksheet
The following worksheet contains solution to some standard data strucutres and algo based problems

1. Given an array of 2N numbers with N odd numbers and N even numbers . WAP to rearrange the numbers in the array such that 
all the even numbers and in the odd indices and all the odd numbers are in the even indices.[Expected time comeplexity O(n)]
Example :
Input -> [20,47,11,5,6,8]
Output -> [5,6,11,20,47,8] (Note that the odd/even numbers do not need to be in the same order as in the input)

Solution: RearrangeOddEvenNumber.py



2.Consider an array of integers. Find an equilibrium element, such that the product of element to the left is equal to 
the product of element to the right. Return the index of equilibrium element. Return -1 if no element is found.
[Expected time complexity = O(n)]
Example:

Input -> [3,2,4,1,6,4]
Output -> 3

Input -> [6,6,1,2,2,3,3]
Output -> 2

Solution: EqulibriumElement.py
